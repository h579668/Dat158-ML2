During this project we will use the eight steps in Appendix B:
</p>
<p>
1. Look at the big picture.<br>
2. Get the data.<br>
3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights.<br>
4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms.<br>
5. Select a model and train it.<br>
6. Fine-tune your model.<br>
7. Present your solution.<br>
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.
</p>
<p>
 You can find step 2-6 in the notebook.
