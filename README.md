<h4>"Playing the whole game"</h4>
<p>  
Box office prediction. This is a Kaggle competition were we are presented with metadata on over 7.000 past films from The Movie Database to try and predict their overall worldwide box office revenue.

During this project we will use the eight steps in Appendix B:
</p>
<p>
1. Look at the big picture.<br>
2. Get the data.<br>
3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights.<br>
4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms.<br>
5. Select a model and train it.<br>
6. Fine-tune your model.<br>
7. Present your solution.<br>
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.
</p>
<p>
 You can find step 2-6 in the notebook.
</p>
<h3> 1. Look at the big picture </h3>
<p>
Here we use supervised learning, since the provided training examples are labeled. The examples will be used learn the machine what it should look for and therafter use it to predict the future.
</p>
<p>
It is both a multiple regression problem, since the data provides multiple features, and a univariate regression problem, since we want to predict one value for a district.
</p>
<h4> Select a Performance Measure </h4>
<p>
Performance Measure gives an idea of how much error the system typically makes in its predictions, with a higher weight for large errors.
</p>
<p>
There are two ways to measure performans: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The main difference between these two is that RMSE is more sensitive to outliers than the MAE. The RMSE performs very well and is generally preferred when outliers are exponentially rare.
</p>
<p>
In this project we will use the RMSE as performance measure.
</p>
<p>Her skal det ligge bilde av RMSE</p>
 <p>
X is a matrix containing all the feature values (excluding labels) of all instances in the dataset. <br>
h is your systemâ€™s prediction function, also called a hypothesis.<br>
m is the number of instances in the dataset you are measuring the RMSE on.<br>
x^(i) is a vector of all the feature values (excluding the label) of the ith instance in the dataset.<br>
y^(i) is its label (the desired output value for that instance).<br>
RMSE(X,h) is the cost function measured on the set of examples using your hypothesis h.<br>
