    Returns the features entered by the user in the web form. 

    To simplify, we set a bunch of default values. 
            For bools and ints, use the most frequent value
            For floats, use the median value

    Note that this represent some major assumptions that you'd 
    not want to make in real life. If you want to use default 
    values for some features then you'll have to think more 
    carefully about what they should be. 

    F.ex. if the user doesn't provide a value for BMI, 
    then one could use a value that makes more sense than 
    below. For example, the mean for the given gender would 
    at least be a bit more correct. 
    
    Having _dynamic defaults_ is important. And of course, if 
    relevant, getting some of the features without asking the user. 
    E.g. if the user is logged in and you can pull information 
    form a user profile. Or if you can compute or obtain the information 
    thorugh other means (e.g. user location if shared etc).
